## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap
- Javascript

### What I learned

Last challenge i learned how to make an error message pop out if the input of a form wasn't filled correctly when submitted, and for this challenge it was interesting to implement that but for several inputs, i also used a different approach for how the error icon appeared, which i think was better than the one i used for last challenge.

### Continued development

I would like to continue learning more about forms and the way i can style them depending on the different events that occur, for example to check in real time if a username is available or if the password meets all the requiered rules.

### Useful resources

- [location.reload()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Location/reload) - I was looking for a way to show the user that the form was submitted correctly once all the input field had correct information and i figured a simple page reload could work, i didn't know how to do that but this page helped with that.
